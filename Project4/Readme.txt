# Book Recommendation and CIFAR-10 Classification Project

## Overview

This project consists of two main functionalities:
1. **Book Recommendation System**: A program to search for books based on keywords in the title, authors, or publisher and display detailed information about the matching books.
2. **CIFAR-10 Image Classification**: A script to load the CIFAR-10 dataset, display a sample of the images, and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

The project contains the following files:
- `bookrecsystem.ipynb`: Script for the book recommendation system.
- `CNN.ipynb`: Script for CIFAR-10 image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
- `books-dataset-2.csv`: CSV file containing book information.
