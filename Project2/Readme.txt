# Project 2: EDA and Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the application of machine learning algorithms using Python. The project includes linear regression and logistic regression models applied to different datasets. The goal is to predict and classify data using these algorithms while performing thorough EDA to understand the data better.

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

- `EDA_and_Regression.py`: This script includes EDA, linear regression, and logistic regression applied to a study performance dataset.
- `Algorithms_ML.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates linear regression and logistic regression on a salary dataset.
- `Salary_Data.csv`: The dataset used in the `Algorithms_ML.ipynb` notebook.
- `study_performance.csv`: The dataset used in the `EDA_and_Regression.py` script.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all dependencies required to run the project.

## Dependencies
To run the project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- `pandas==2.0.3`
- `numpy==1.24.3`
- `scikit-learn==1.2.2`
- `matplotlib==3.7.1`
- `seaborn==0.12.2`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
